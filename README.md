# Thermodynamic framework for EVo

This is a thermodynamic framework developed by Kilbride et al. (2016) and refined by Yip et al. (2022).

This notebook processes output from EVo thermodynamic model (Liggins et al., 2020, 2022) to: 
- visualise magma properties as a function of depth (e.g., volatile content in melt, gas volume fraction, density) 
- calculate observable parameters (e.g., SOâ‚‚, volume change and displacement, all normalised by per unit volume erupted)
