# Thermodynamic framework for EVo

This is a thermodynamic framework developed by Kilbride et al. (2016) and refined by Yip et al. (2022). 

In this version, we incorporate pre-eruptive exsolved volatile segregation into the thermodynamic model.

This notebook processes output from EVo thermodynamic model (Liggins et al., 2020, 2022) to: 
- visualise magma properties as a function of depth (e.g., volatile content in melt, gas volume fraction, density) 
- calculate observable parameters (e.g., SOâ‚‚, volume change and displacement, all normalised by per unit volume erupted)
- *NEW!* simulate pre-eruptive gas accumulation/ loss

To simulate pre-eruptive exsolve volatile segregation, please modify the value of constant k to a number greater than -1 in L424 of dgs_classes.py file in the EVo thermodynamic model.
